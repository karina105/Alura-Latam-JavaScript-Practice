<h1>JavaScript Practice</h1>

- During this course, I followed the instructor's guidance to complete a practice project where a webpage was created using programming languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project focused on implementing logic with JavaScript while utilizing HTML for page structure and CSS for customization.

- Under the instructor's direction, various JavaScript tools including functions, the let keyword for declaring variables, document.querySelector() for accessing HTML elements, and conditionals such as if and else were utilized. These elements were essential in creating the functionality of the webpage.

- The core functionality of the project revolved around a guessing game where the user attempted to guess a secret number chosen randomly by the program. The user's input was compared to the secret number, and appropriate feedback was provided based on whether the guess was correct or not. Additionally, the program tracked the number of attempts made by the user.

- The project provided valuable hands-on experience in web development, allowing me to apply the concepts learned in the course under the instructor's guidance and enhance practical skills in JavaScript programming.
